# Deep Research

Conduct comprehensive research on: $ARGUMENTS

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Initial Search
1. **Understand the query**
   - Break down the research question into key concepts
   - Identify what type of information is needed (technical, business, implementation, etc.)

2. **Search for authoritative sources**
   - Use WebSearch to find recent, relevant information
   - Prioritize official documentation, academic papers, and trusted technical blogs
   - Look for multiple perspectives on the topic

### Phase 2: Deep Dive
3. **Fetch and analyze key sources**
   - Use WebFetch to read full content from promising URLs
   - Extract relevant code examples, patterns, and best practices
   - Note any caveats, limitations, or version-specific information

4. **Cross-reference findings**
   - Compare information across sources
   - Identify consensus vs. disputed approaches
   - Note any outdated information (check dates)

### Phase 3: Synthesize
5. **Compile findings**
   - Organize information by relevance to the original query
   - Highlight practical takeaways
   - Include code examples where applicable
